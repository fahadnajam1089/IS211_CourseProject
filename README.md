# There are 2 users in the database for the book catalog. Credentials below:

# username  password
# admin     password
# Fahad     password

# The extra credit for the assignment was completed but 2 parts are missing. 
# The completed parts are: 
# 1. Extend the application to support multiple users: You do not have to worry about supporting
# a full registration workflow. Use a table in the database to store users and their credentials,
# and use this table to support logins from many accounts. Please note: storing passwords
# that are unencrypted is a bad idea, security wise. However, there is no need for us to delve
# into that.

# 3. Handling multiple responses from Google: If the Google API gives you many responses for
# a single ISBN number, show the user the list of results and allow them to choose which one
# is the one they want to add to their list.

# The one's I couldn't complete are:
# 2. Save links to thumbnails: Use the JSON data to save the URL of a thumbnail, and show
# this thumbnail when listing out a userâ€™s set of books.
# 4. Allow searching by title: Figure out how to use the Google API to search by title. -->
